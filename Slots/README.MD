# Casino Slot Machine
This is my very first project in .JS. I made classical 3x3 casino slot machine.

## How to spin
Just select starting amount of "money," then select on how many lines do u wanna place a bet
and then select your final bet. After each spin end, you can choose to continue with gambling
or to stop.

Game gonna itself if your balance fall below 0.
